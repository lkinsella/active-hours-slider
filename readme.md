# Active Hours Slider

Windows Update has a feature whereby it will not reboot your computer during active hours. You can set these in update UI to a 12-hour window.

So that begs the question, what if we move that 12-hour window, in effect, _slide_ it throughout the day?

To that end this project is a _hack_ of sorts that allows you to do just that.

There are two options, a Windows Service or a console application. 

I tend to use the console application via the Task Scheduler on a 4 hourly execution schedule.
